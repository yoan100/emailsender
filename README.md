## Usage

example code:

   ```html

## Notes
- Do not use your main Gmail account. Create a dedicated account for sending.
- Gmail sending limit: ~500 emails/day for normal accounts.
- All emails will be sent to **one recipient**. For multiple recipients, the script needs an extension.
- The script is new, create an issue if you need help!
- Email providers may flag your emails as spam! Edit the code if you want to bypass a certain spam filter.
